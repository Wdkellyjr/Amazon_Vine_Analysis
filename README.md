# Project Overview

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to help a data analytics company, Big Market, client see how reviews of their products compare to reviews of their competitors. The client is also interested in enrolling in a program that gives out free products to some of their reviewers, but they want to make sure itâ€™s worth the cost. The reviews are in letters, not numbers, so different big data applications will be used to convert the data.
